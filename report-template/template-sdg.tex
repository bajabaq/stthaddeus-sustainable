\section*{Summary}
A summary statement of the goals goes here

\cref{tab:summary} shows a summary of where we stand as of 20XX. The xxMSAxx ranks xxRANKxx out of 105 U.S. metropolitan areas, as measured by these 17 goals, with an average score of xxAVGSCORExx\% across all. Two of the goals, 14 - Life Below Water and 17 - Partnerships for the Goals, are not being measured, for any city, because there are no currently measurable data for them. Other data gaps exist and are detailed in \cref{sec:datagap}. Below each top-level goal are the measurable targets. The normalized value of how close our community comes to these targets determines our score, and the average of these scores is the score for the goal.

TODO THIS SUMMARY TABLE IS NOT COMPLETE (NORM SCORE VS RAW)

%1/17 is 0.0588
%1/18 is 0.0556

%do the tabsep before the first colum and all the rest
\input{summary-table}

The remainder of this document details the performance of our community on the individual targets at the rates/units described.
